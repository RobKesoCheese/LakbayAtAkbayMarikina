    <h2>Discover More About Marikina</h2>
     <p>
    Marikina traces its beginnings to the late 1500s, during the early years of 
    Spanish colonization in the Philippines. Originally known as <em>Mariquina</em>, 
    after Spanish Captain Berenguer de Mariquina, the area was a quiet agricultural 
    settlement sustained by farming, fishing, and weaving. Its fertile land along the 
    Marikina River made it a natural hub for agriculture and trade, and by the 18th 
    century, it had grown into a flourishing pueblo with a strong sense of community.
  </p>

  <p>
    The late 19th century marked a turning point in Marikina’s history with the 
    introduction of shoemaking. Local artisans, combining ingenuity with discipline, 
    transformed the small town into the country’s center of quality footwear production. 
    By the early 20th century, Marikina had earned the title 
    <strong>“Shoe Capital of the Philippines”</strong>, producing shoes that were 
    recognized for their craftsmanship and durability both locally and internationally. 
    This industry not only provided livelihood for generations of Marikeños but also 
    became a symbol of the city’s identity and pride.
  </p>

  <p>
    Marikina’s history has also been shaped by resilience. The city endured floods, 
    natural disasters, and the challenges of modernization, yet its people consistently 
    rebuilt and innovated. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Marikina became 
    known as a model city for good governance, cleanliness, and orderliness, setting 
    an example for urban management in the Philippines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, Marikina City continues to honor its shoemaking heritage while embracing 
    modern progress. With its blend of tradition, discipline, and innovation, it remains 
    a city that tells the story of Filipino craftsmanship and resilience—living up to its 
    legacy as both a cultural landmark and the proud 
    <strong>Heart of Philippine Shoemaking</strong>.
